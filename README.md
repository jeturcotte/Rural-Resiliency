# Rural-Resiliency

An experimental project to create a free and cheap-to-host framework deployable in rural areas to encourage resilience through networking and access to metro area opportunities that may be missed otherwise.

# Goals

The core intent behind this project is to do something that might provide flagging rural communities with a sense of self-empowerment and inter-resiliency that may be the flagstone in constructing a new wave of optimism... and that really is the most important fuel for life.

## Deploying an Inexpensive and Extensible Framework

Particularly core to the idea is that there's a deployable node of software that acts as a lightweight supervisor of all applications and communications within the community it serves.  This needs to be relatively light weight, modestly powerful, easy to install, easy to run, easy to compliment with a community-built set of applications, and inexpensive to host.  For most rural communities, a single desktop computer might be sufficient to keep the local deployment running, costing a few tens of dollars at month, perhaps, at most.

## Interweaving a Community

Given deployment, this framework should be able to rapidly allow the community to focus on identifying their assets, and setting up a second economy, so to speak... a trade of skills, resources, time, et cetera, such that people feel useful, valued, and buoyed by the same from their neighbors.

In other words, this might help visualize a community's hidden safety net that might otherwise might have been overlooked in hard times.  Moreover, genuinely knowing about the condition of the community and it's geographical limitations, the residents may be far better prepared to anticipate and weather these hard times.

## Extending Urban Opportunities to the Countryside 

Currently, there's a psychological divide in this nation.  Many of those (if not all) in the big cities are enjoying opportunities and economies that are far superior to those available to those in the countryside.  Most simply won't know that such forward looking organizations as the National Science Foundation or the US Patent and Trademark Office exist, much less are openly accessible to them.  As such, having these nodes operating out in the countryside could easily create a cooperative bridge with such organizations (and businesses, perhaps) such that new generations in the countryside get the same access to bright futures that city kids are often able to take for granted.

# Sub-Projects

## Identifying an Area In Need

One small and early project will be deriving an algorithm or statistical model, likely fueled by census.gov data, and visualized via GIS techniques, to discover loci in the countryside that might be best for the deployment of such framework nodes.

## Framework Development

TBD

## Recommended Hardware

TBD

## Communication Alternatives

One difficulty to be overcome is that many rural communities could very easily lack the internet infrastructure that we here in the D.C. area take for granted.  To that end, being that neither this project nor the communities are likely to have the resources to simply install broadband, would be to explore alternative deployment or communication techniques to facilitate all this in spite of that.
